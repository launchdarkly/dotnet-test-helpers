The [`LaunchDarkly.TestHelpers`](https://nuget.org/packages/LaunchDarkly.TestHelpers) package centralizes some test support code that is used by LaunchDarkly's .NET and Xamarin SDKs and related components, and that may be useful in other .NET projects.

While this code may be useful in other projects, it is primarily geared toward LaunchDarkly's own development needs and is not meant to provide a large general-purpose framework. It is meant for unit test code and should not be used as a runtime dependency.
